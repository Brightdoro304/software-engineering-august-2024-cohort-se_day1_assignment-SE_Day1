#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.


Software engineering has evolved significantly over the years, with key milestones marking its growth into a mature discipline. Here are three key milestones in its evolution:

1. The Birth of Software Engineering (1968)
Milestone: The term "software engineering" was first introduced at the 1968 NATO Software Engineering Conference.
Significance: At this time, software development faced a "software crisis" due to increased complexity, late deliveries, budget overruns, and buggy software. The conference highlighted the need to adopt engineering principles for software development to address these issues. It marked the beginning of software engineering as a formal discipline and set the stage for structured approaches to software design and development.
2. The Advent of Structured Programming (1970s)
Milestone: Structured programming emerged in the 1970s with languages like C, Pascal, and Ada.
Significance: Before structured programming, software development often relied on unstructured, "spaghetti code," which was difficult to maintain and debug. The structured programming paradigm introduced disciplined coding practices, emphasizing modularization, control structures like loops and conditionals, and clear flow of execution. This shift laid the foundation for improving software quality, maintainability, and readability.
3. The Agile Manifesto (2001)
Milestone: The Agile Manifesto was published in 2001, introducing a new approach to software development that prioritized flexibility and customer collaboration.
Significance: Agile methods, such as Scrum and XP (Extreme Programming), emphasized iterative development, regular feedback, and adapting to change, contrasting with the heavyweight Waterfall model. The Agile movement transformed how software was developed, making processes more responsive to customer needs and improving delivery timelines, which is particularly crucial in the modern era of fast-evolving technology.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
