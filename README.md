#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Waterfall vs. Agile Methodologies
Waterfall Methodology is a traditional, linear approach to software development where the project is divided into distinct phases: Requirements, Design, Implementation, Verification (Testing), and Maintenance. Each phase must be completed before moving to the next, and changes are typically difficult to accommodate once the project is underway.

Agile Methodology is an iterative, flexible approach that emphasizes continuous collaboration and responsiveness to change. Development occurs in small, incremental cycles known as sprints, with regular feedback and adaptation.

Key Comparisons:
Aspect	Waterfall	Agile
Approach	Sequential, linear	Iterative, incremental
Planning	Heavy up-front planning; all requirements defined before development starts	Minimal up-front planning; requirements evolve throughout the project
Flexibility	Rigid; changes are costly and difficult to manage once a phase is completed	Highly flexible; changes are embraced and expected
Timeline	Long phases; project is typically delivered at the end of the process	Short sprints (typically 2-4 weeks); delivery is ongoing
Client Involvement	Minimal after the requirements phase	Continuous involvement and feedback at every sprint
Risk Management	Risks are identified and addressed during the planning phase	Risks are continuously managed through iterations
Testing	Occurs at the end of the development process	Ongoing; testing is integrated into each sprint
Documentation	Extensive and detailed	Light; focuses on working software rather than comprehensive documentation
Team Collaboration	Less emphasis on collaboration during development	Emphasizes cross-functional team collaboration throughout the project
When to Use Waterfall:
Well-defined requirements: Waterfall works best when requirements are clear, well-documented, and unlikely to change.

Example: A government contract where strict specifications must be followed or a highly regulated industry like aerospace engineering.
Predictable projects: Projects that follow a predictable, repeatable process or involve minimal client feedback.

Example: Developing a payroll processing system where regulations and requirements are static.
Large-scale infrastructure projects: Waterfall is suitable for projects like construction or manufacturing, where a structured, linear approach is essential.

When to Use Agile:
Dynamic, evolving requirements: Agile is ideal when the projectâ€™s scope may change or the client is unsure of exact requirements.

Example: Startups developing innovative apps or software products, where market demands and feedback will evolve over time.
Complex software development: Agile allows teams to quickly adapt to technological advances or evolving user needs.

Example: Building a web-based e-commerce platform where customer feedback influences ongoing development.
Continuous delivery projects: Agile excels in projects that require frequent updates or are delivered in smaller releases.

Example: SaaS (Software as a Service) projects that need regular feature rollouts and updates.










Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
